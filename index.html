    <h1>Don't Touch My Hair</h1>
    <h3>Solange Knowles</h3>
    <p>
      Don't touch my hair When it's the feelings I wear
      <br>Don't touch my soul When it's the rhythm I know
      <br>Don't touch my crown
      <br>They say the vision I've found
      <br>Don't touch what's there
      <br>When it's the feelings I wear
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>They don't understand
      <br>What it means to me
      <br>Where we chose to go
      <br>Where we've been to know
      <br>They don't understand
      <br>What it means to me
      <br>Where we chose to go
      <br>Where we've been to know
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>You know this hair is my shit
      <br>Rode the ride, I gave it time
      <br>But this here is mine
      <br>You know this hair is my shit
      <br>Rode the ride, I gave it time
      <br>But this here is mine
      <br>What you say, oh?
      <br>What you say to me?
